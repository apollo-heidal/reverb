# Reverb Demo E2E, Installation, And Coordinator Hardening Plan

## Purpose

This plan defines the next implementation phase for `reverb` after the initial
coordinator architecture refactor.

The goals are:

- prove the full emitter -> coordinator -> isolated dev workspace -> validation
  loop end to end
- avoid Apollo as a test target
- make Reverb easy to add to a normal Elixir project
- shift the default coding-agent strategy toward a single external multiprovider
  CLI wrapper such as Hermes or OpenCode
- keep the demo intentionally simple so failures mean integration bugs rather
  than model-capability issues
- establish a clean Docker Compose based workflow for local iteration
- prepare for a later self-hosting experiment where Reverb coordinates work on
  itself

## Success Criteria

The phase is successful when all of the following are true:

1. A throwaway Elixir demo app runs in one container as a production-mode
   emitter.
2. A separate Reverb container runs in receiver/coordinator mode.
3. The emitter sends simple periodic feature requests or fault signals over
   distributed Erlang and PubSub.
4. Reverb receives the messages, triages them into tasks, checks out lawful
   workspaces against an isolated dev clone of the demo app, invokes a coding
   agent CLI, runs validation commands, and records runs/tasks correctly.
5. The demo tasks are simple enough that success is attributable to integration
   correctness rather than frontier-model reasoning skill.
6. Reverb can be added to an Elixir project with a low-friction installation
   path, ideally via Igniter-generated config and assets.

## Guiding Constraints

- Do not use Apollo as the test application.
- Do not spend time debugging ambitious autonomous coding tasks during this
  phase.
- Keep the target app and emitted tasks intentionally small and deterministic.
- Preserve Reverb’s project-agnostic design.
- Keep the current CLI wrapper modules.
- Add Hermes support without removing Claude, Codex, or generic CLI support.
- Treat remote git push/PR flow as optional for this phase.

## Deliverable Overview

This phase should produce:

- a demo emitter app
- Docker Compose infrastructure for emitter + reverb + Postgres
- a clear Reverb installation story for existing Elixir apps
- a Hermes CLI adapter
- end-to-end test instructions and scripted verification
- a narrow feature/task corpus for iterative validation

## Workstream 1: Demo Target App

### Objective

Create a minimal Elixir target app whose job is to emit controlled signals and
serve as the sandbox codebase Reverb modifies.

### Shape

Build a tiny Mix app, not Phoenix, unless HTTP is genuinely needed for a simple
validation hook.

Suggested structure:

- one supervision tree
- one emitter loop process
- one small feature module under active development
- one test file covering the active feature module

Suggested example app name:

- `reverb_demo_app`

### Behavior

The demo app should:

- hold a hardcoded list of very small feature requests or defects
- emit one item on a timer every few minutes, or on a shorter interval in dev
  mode for faster iteration
- send them as `Reverb.emit(:manual, ...)` or `Reverb.emit(:warning, ...)`
- include structured metadata for subject, requested change, and validation hint

### Feature Corpus

Use tasks that are easy to implement and easy to verify. Examples:

- add `MathFeature.double/1`
- add `StringFeature.reverse_words/1`
- add `ListFeature.sum_even/1`
- add a missing `@spec`
- add a missing unit test for a stubbed function
- implement a simple pure function with exact expected outputs
- replace a placeholder return like `:not_implemented`

Avoid:

- database features
- distributed logic inside the demo app
- LiveView or browser work
- large refactors
- tasks requiring external APIs

### Recommended code layout

- `lib/reverb_demo_app/application.ex`
- `lib/reverb_demo_app/emitter.ex`
- `lib/reverb_demo_app/feature_backlog.ex`
- `lib/reverb_demo_app/simple_features.ex`
- `test/reverb_demo_app/simple_features_test.exs`

### Emission strategy

The emitter should draw from a hardcoded list of items shaped like:

```elixir
%{
  id: "demo-double",
  subject: "simple_features.double/1",
  body: "Implement double/1 so it returns n * 2 and add tests.",
  validation: ["mix test test/reverb_demo_app/simple_features_test.exs"]
}
```

The emitted Reverb metadata should include:

- `subject`
- `feature_id`
- `validation_commands`
- `expected_files`
- `difficulty: "trivial"`

## Workstream 2: Compose-Based E2E Environment

### Objective

Run the loop in a realistic but disposable environment:

- one container for the prod-style emitter app
- one container for Reverb as receiver/coordinator
- one Postgres container for Reverb state

### Compose topology

Services:

- `demo-prod`
- `reverb-db`
- `reverb`

Optional later:

- `demo-dev-shell` if a separate mutable app container is needed

### Network

Use one shared Docker network with:

- distributed Erlang node names
- a shared cookie
- fixed or documented distribution port range

### Volumes

Use persistent named volumes for:

- Reverb Postgres data
- Reverb workspace root
- isolated dev clone of the demo app
- optional CLI auth/config storage

### Container responsibilities

`demo-prod`:

- boot the demo app in emitter mode
- periodically emit demo tasks
- expose logs only

`reverb`:

- boot in receiver mode
- connect to the demo prod node
- maintain durable task/run state
- manage workspaces against the isolated dev clone
- run validation commands inside the dev clone

### Reverb image requirements

The Reverb dev/coordinator image should include:

- Elixir and Erlang
- git
- bash/sh
- the selected coding CLI binary or installation method
- any runtime needed for validation of the target app

Do not hardwire Apollo-specific assumptions.

### Dev-clone workflow

The Reverb container should operate against a mounted or initialized clone of
the demo app repository.

Preferred pattern:

- keep an immutable source checkout or image content
- create worktrees from the isolated clone root
- never let agents edit the coordinator repo during this phase

## Workstream 3: Installation UX For Existing Elixir Apps

### Objective

Make embedding Reverb in a normal Elixir app low-friction and predictable.

### Igniter support

Add an Igniter-based installer or generator path for host apps.

Potential commands:

- `mix igniter.install reverb`
- `mix reverb.install`
- `mix reverb.init`

The installer should be able to:

- add `{:reverb, ...}` to `mix.exs`
- insert `config :reverb` defaults into `config/config.exs`
- insert prod emitter defaults into `config/prod.exs`
- insert runtime overrides into `config/runtime.exs`
- optionally add Logger/Telemetry handler configuration
- generate a BEAM shared cookie if one does not exist
- document node naming expectations
- generate a starter `docker-compose.reverb.yml` or equivalent local coordinator
  asset
- generate a sample `.env.reverb`

### Installer output

For a host app, the generated assets should include:

- emitter config stanzas
- a cookie file or env var guidance
- a sample topic hash
- a coordinator compose file template
- short README instructions for connecting the app to Reverb

### Safety defaults

Generated defaults should:

- leave remote push disabled
- leave protected branches configured
- prefer localhost or explicitly named dev hosts
- use a unique topic hash per project

## Workstream 4: Agent Strategy And Hermes Integration

### Objective

Make the default coding-agent path easier for users by preferring a
multiprovider CLI wrapper layer rather than wiring individual inference APIs
directly into Reverb.

### Direction

Keep the current CLI abstraction modules:

- generic
- Claude
- Codex

Add:

- Hermes CLI adapter

Potentially later:

- OpenCode adapter as another preferred default

### Why Hermes

Hermes can centralize:

- provider selection
- API key handling
- model routing
- inference backend specifics

That allows Reverb to focus on:

- task orchestration
- workspace safety
- git policy
- validation and promotion

### Hermes adapter requirements

Add a module such as:

- `lib/reverb/agent/cli/hermes.ex`

It should support:

- non-interactive prompt execution
- explicit working directory
- timeout enforcement
- structured output capture
- configurable binary path
- configurable provider/model flags

### Default recommendation

Change the documented default coding-agent path from Claude to Hermes once the
Hermes adapter is stable.

Do not remove current adapters.

### Config additions

Add config support for:

- `agent_adapter: :hermes`
- Hermes CLI path
- provider/model selection
- API key env passthrough expectations

## Workstream 5: E2E Validation Flow

### Objective

Prove that Reverb can not only execute agent tasks but also validate and sort
them correctly.

### Initial validation policy

For the demo app, use narrow commands only:

- `mix compile`
- `mix test test/reverb_demo_app/simple_features_test.exs`

Do not run broad suites initially.

### Reverb task metadata

Allow task metadata to optionally override validation commands so the emitter
can steer validation for each trivial feature.

### Success path

For each demo task:

1. emitter sends message
2. receiver stores raw message
3. triage creates task
4. scheduler claims task
5. worker checks out workspace
6. agent edits trivial feature code
7. Reverb commits in workspace
8. Reverb runs validation
9. task becomes stable on success
10. optional local branch remains for inspection

### Failure path

If validation fails:

- run should be marked failed
- task should keep failure output
- task should be retryable
- workspace cleanup behavior should be explicit and deterministic

## Workstream 6: Steering And Observability For The Demo Phase

### Objective

Add enough visibility that the Compose demo is inspectable without digging into
the database manually.

### Minimum v1 steering surface

Before building a full web UI, make sure these are available:

- `Reverb.status/0`
- `Reverb.agents_status/0`
- `Reverb.tasks/1`
- `Reverb.runs/1`
- runtime event stream over local PubSub

### Immediate next operator tool

Prefer a tiny localhost HTTP/JSON surface next, with:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/status`
- `GET /api/tasks`
- `GET /api/runs`
- `POST /api/scheduler/pause`
- `POST /api/scheduler/resume`

This does not need to block the Compose demo if shell inspection is enough.

## Workstream 7: Test Matrix

### Automated tests in this repo

Keep and extend:

- unit tests for claims
- path safety
- task/run transitions
- git branch guardrails
- validation command handling
- loop scheduling behavior

Add later:

- Hermes adapter tests
- workspace pool tests
- remote promotion tests with mocked `gh`
- igniter installer tests

### End-to-end tests

Create a demo walkthrough that verifies:

- node connectivity
- message emission
- task creation
- run creation
- workspace creation
- agent invocation
- validation success
- task stabilization

### Acceptance script

Add a script or checklist that:

- boots the compose stack
- waits for initial emission
- inspects Reverb status
- confirms a trivial feature was implemented in the isolated dev clone
- confirms validation passed

## Workstream 8: Self-Hosting Follow-Up

### Objective

After the demo app succeeds, use Reverb as a target for Reverb itself.

### Why later

Self-hosting is valuable, but only after:

- workspaces are trustworthy
- branch safety is proven
- validation hooks are stable
- steering is minimally usable

### Recommended sequence

1. complete trivial demo app loop
2. complete install UX for external apps
3. stabilize Hermes/default agent path
4. add minimal steering HTTP API
5. then attempt Reverb-on-Reverb in a sandboxed clone

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase A: Demo App

- scaffold `reverb_demo_app`
- hardcode trivial feature backlog
- emit signals on a timer
- add narrow tests and validation hooks

### Phase B: Compose Environment

- add `docker-compose.demo.yml`
- add Reverb dev Dockerfile
- add demo app Dockerfile
- establish node naming, cookie, network, and volume conventions

### Phase C: Hermes Adapter

- add `Reverb.Agent.CLI.Hermes`
- add config and docs
- switch docs to recommend Hermes as the default adapter

### Phase D: Install UX

- design Igniter installer
- generate config, cookie, env, and compose scaffolding for host apps
- add installer docs

### Phase E: Full Demo Verification

- boot compose stack
- verify emitter -> receiver flow
- verify trivial autonomous implementation loop
- document operator commands and expected state transitions

### Phase F: Steering Surface

- add minimal localhost JSON/health endpoints
- expose task/run/runtime status cleanly

## Explicit Defaults For This Phase

- default demo target is a throwaway Elixir app, not Apollo
- default autonomous tasks are trivial pure-function changes
- default remote push/PR is disabled
- default coding-agent direction moves toward Hermes
- default coordinator promotion remains local-branch-first
- default environment for iteration is Docker Compose

## Open Implementation Notes

- If Hermes proves awkward as a CLI boundary, OpenCode remains a valid fallback
  preferred default.
- The demo should optimize for debugging Reverb, not showcasing model depth.
- The demo emitter can start with short intervals like 10-30 seconds for local
  iteration, then increase later.
- The demo app should include a fixed list of tasks rather than randomly
  inventing them.
- Reverb should eventually consume structured validation hints from task
  metadata rather than only from static config.

## Definition Of Done

This phase is done when:

- a new user can clone Reverb, boot the Compose demo, and watch tasks flow from
  a tiny BEAM emitter into Reverb
- Reverb can implement and validate at least one trivial feature end to end in
  the isolated dev clone
- Hermes support exists and is documented as the preferred default path
- the repo contains a concrete plan and initial scaffolding for Igniter-based
  installation into third-party Elixir apps
- the system is positioned for a later Reverb-on-Reverb self-hosting test
